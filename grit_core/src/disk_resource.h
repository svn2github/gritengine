/** \file
 *
 * Grit's resource subsystem allows disk data to transition between a loaded
 * and unloaded state.  The intention is to manage memory usage by only keeping
 * a necessary subset of all the disk resources loaded simultaneously.  There
 * are many kinds of disk resources, including meshes, textures, audio files,
 * collision meshes, etc.  In each case, 'unloaded' means existing only on
 * disk, and 'loaded' means ready for use.  There is also a system for
 * registering one's need for a particular resource, so that automatic memory
 * management can avoid unloading resources that are currently in use.
 *
 * In addition to this, one can reload resources, which is useful for
 * development of games, where e.g. textures can be tweaked on disk and
 * reloaded in the game for instant preview.

 * Subclasses of DiskResource define different kinds of data, such as audio,
 * textures, etc.  Each disk resource can be in a loaded or unloaded state.  In
 * addition to this, each resource keeps a counter of the number of 'users' it
 * has, who register/unregister their need for the resource.  Loaded resources
 * with no users are subject to be automatically unloaded if system memory
 * becomes tight.
 *
 * Note that users>0 and loaded are not logically related.  Just because a
 * resource is loaded, does not mean it is still in use, as resources are
 * cached according to a least-recently-used policy.  Just because a resource
 * has registered users, does not mean it is loaded, as one can explicitly
 * unload a resource, or a resource can be marked as being used but not be
 * loaded yet.
 *
 * Each resource can depend on any number of other resources to form an acylic
 * graph.  This is e.g. for meshes that use materials (and thus textures), and
 * also for collision meshes that have procedural vegetation. The dependencies
 * are discovered when loading the resource, and loading a resource will load
 * its dependencies automatically.  Therefore the set of dependencies of an
 * unloaded resource is always empty.  Also, if users>0 on a resource, then the
 * dependencies automatically have a user registered for the depending resource
 * so one only has to register use of the top-level resource.
