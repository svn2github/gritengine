/** A streamed game object, occupying a place in the map.
 *
 * Grit bjects are instances of Grit Classes (\see GritClass).  The class is a
 * blueprint of the object, and is intended define the majority of the object's
 * qualities and behaviour.  Once created, they are either in a 'deactivated'
 * state, meaning the player is outside the object's rendering distance, or
 * 'activated' otherwise.  The intent is that when deactivated, the object is
 * in a low-resource state where very little memory and no CPU resources are
 * required.  In particular, no Lua heap resources are used when the object is
 * deactivated, as all its state is stored in an ExternalTable.  This means
 * garbage collection remains fast as the map scales up.  There are a number of
 * Lua callbacks that are issued by the object when its state changes or when
 * other interesting events occur.  These callbacks are the basis of user
 * scripts to create active objects, i.e. objects that appear alive or react to
 * stimuli.
 *
 * When the object is activated, it has a Lua table which holds its state and
 * is maintained by the Lua scripts that define its behaviour.  When it is
 * deactivated, this table is destroyed and the only persistent state is held
 * in the External table in the object itself.
 *
 * The object is typically referred to via a reference counting smart pointer,
 * and many of the member functions in this class require that smart pointer to
 * be passed in, becuase they need to pass it on to Lua or whatever.  In such
 * cases the parameter is called 'self' and it is essentially the same as
 * 'this', except for having the refernece counter information attached.
