Should use doxygen for input libraries

Mouse:

The function getEvents should be called regularly (once per frame drawn is OK).

No matter what the situation regarding availability of input devices or
presence of fresh mouse events, if any of the parameters are non-NULL, they
will have a reasonable value written to them.

The parameter "clicks" is cleared and then populated with the button presses
(if any).  Into "x" and "y" will be written the new co-ordinates, which will be
the same as last reported if there was no movement.  Into "rel_x" and "rel_y"
will be written the distance moved since the last call, or 0 if there was no
movement.  If the device was available and mouse movement occured, getEvents
returns true, otherwise false.

You can setGrab or setHide at any time, but if grab is active when the mouse
pointer is visible, the cursor may not appear in the right place.  It is
advisable to hide the cursor during mouse grab.
