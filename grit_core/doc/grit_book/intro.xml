The Grit Game Engine allows you to create interactive 3D environments such
as computer games.  Its fundamental architecture is based around the Lua
scripting language.  Games are created by creating custom behaviours for
objects in the scene, the scene itself, and on-screen HUD objects.  This is
done at a very high level, with an easy-to-use programming model.  The in-game
Lua console allows experimentation, debugging, and development while the game
is running.

The engine is very general-purpose.  This is achieved by having independent
object-oriented APIs for the various subsystems (graphics, physics, audio,
input, etc).  These are tied together by the object framework, which is also
exposed via Lua.

As a trivial example, a ball of energy that floats up and down could be
implemented with an object.  The game designer writes a class with an
initialisation callback that creates a graphics body in the graphics world, and
stores a pointer to it in a field of the new object.  The class also has a
destruction callback that can be used to clean up the graphics body when the
object is removed from the scene.  Finally, there is a per-step callback to
move the ball around, presumably using a sin function or similar.  If a light
source is desired, then a light body would be created in the graphics world as
well, and e.g. its intensity can be modified in the step callback.  Similarly,
other graphics bodies, particles, and physical behaviour can be added if
desired.  Audio bodies can be added in the audio world.  All of these "bodies",
which manifest in independent subsystems, are created and controlled by the
object in question.

The lower level performance critical parts of the engine, such as the
rendering pipeline and the collision detection, are written in C++.  However
the Lua bindings are designed to be as expressive and safe as was possible
without compromising on performance.
