    Grit's audio support supports loading audio files from disk and playing
    them.  PCM (wav files) and OGG vorbis files are supported.  Sound files can
    be mono or stereo.  Sounds can either be <def>instantaneous</def> or
    <def>continuous</def>, and, unrelatedly, they can either be
    <def>ambient</def> or <def>positional</def>.  Those 2 categories yield 4
    possibilities.

    Instantaneous sounds are usually short, they are used for bangs and throw
    away noises.  They always play to completion and they cannot be paused, or
    have their volume or pitch changed while the sound is playing.

    Ambient sounds play in the same manner everywhere.  They are typically used
    for environemntal noise.  They are usually stereo, and the channels are
    mapped directly to the computer's speakers.

    Positional sounds have a position in the 3D world, and their volume (and
    possibly other effects) is controlled automatically based on distance to
    the camera and other factors.  Instantaneous positional sounds play to
    completion at a fixed point, typically used for impact sounds and similar
    events.  Typically these are mono soundeffects.  If not, then two mono
    sound emitters are created a fixed distance apart, according to a rotation
    parameter.

    <section title="Audio Bodies" id="audio_bodies">
    
        Continuous sounds are implemented with <def>audio
        bodies</def> which have fields and methods via which the playback can
        be controlled after the sound has started playing.  

        Audio bodies playing positional sounds can have their position updated
        at run-time.
