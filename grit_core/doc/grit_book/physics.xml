    The physics subsystem exists independently of the graphics subsystem.
    There can be physics bodies that have no graphical representation (i.e.
    invisible), and equally there can be graphics bodies that have no physical
    representation (e.g. particles / ghosts).

    The physics subsystem exposes a <def>physics world</def> in which
    <def>physics bodies</def> can be created to interact with each other.  It
    is also possible to do spatial queries, like <def>ray</def> casts,
    <def>sweeps</def> of various shapes and collision volume <def>tests</def>.
    Callbacks and query results from the physics world are used by Lua scripts
    to update graphics and perform game logic.

    <section title="Physics Bodies" id="physics_bodies">

        Physics Bodies exist in the physics world.  Every game step, their
        position and orientation are updated based on rigid body dynamics and
        other physical simulation.  Typically, this information is used to
        update graphics objects but in principle it could be used for anything.
