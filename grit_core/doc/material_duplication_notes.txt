Things that should be autodetected from mesh:

        "vertexAlpha"
        "vertexAmbient" 
        "vertexColour"
        "blendedBones" 0 1 2 3 4

I think it is not possible to autodetect these, as we do not know e.g. whether
a set of vertex colours in the mesh is meant to be used for ambient lighting or
as a colour mask, or even at all.  We can however warn if the material is expecting something from the mesh which is not present.

Things that we need due to batching
        "worldGeometry"

uniform masks:

        "diffuseColour"
        "ambientColour"
        "specularColour"
        "specularity"

render operation tweaks:
        "backfaces"
        "alpha"
        "depthSort"
        "depthWrite"
        "alphaToCoverage"

misc uniforms for receiver pass
        "alphaReject"
        "shadowReceive"
        "shadowObliqueCutOff"
        "stipple"
        "grassLighting"
        "uvScale"

misc uniforms for caster pass
        "castShadows"
        "shadowAlphaReject"
        "shadowBias"
