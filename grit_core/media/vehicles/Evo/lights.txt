---EXTERIOR---
headlights - replace off texture with on texture emissive, directional spotlight cone with billboard 2dtexture halo, warm white or halogen varieties
taillights - replace off texture with on texture emissive, low range falloff omni red with billboard 2dtexture halo, red
brakelights - replace off texture with on texture emissive, low range falloff omni warm or cool white varieties, 2dtexture halo, warm or cool white 
blinkers - replace off texture with on texture emissive, low range falloff orange omni blinking while turning or earlier for ped AI that anticipates turn
Ground FX lighting RGB override of 2D shadow(?) - This is important. I don't care for them, but car modders do.

---INTERIOR---
dashboard - emissive or vertex colour, can be on at all times, only when car is running
stereo - emissive or vertex color, some are not lit/not digital, some are animated - works only when car is running
Interior lights - roof light and door lights, on when doors are open. Some cars turn off when door shut, some fade/dim to off over 5 seconds.
boot light - I can't see any reason to open the boot, but if you want to, it should have a light. not the hood though.


Many of these should be condensed into a single type of light that can be on, off, or fade for five seconds.
That single type of light is bitmap dependant and has an on-off states, many headlights can be atlased to one sheet.
lights are defined by being seperate meshes in the master hierarchy and dummies place the location of the omni or spot for each light element.
I do not have thoughts yet on how to define what kind of lights, perhaps appended from the name of the mesh IE headlights_hallogen, headlights_white
I would probably advice against omnis unless the car itself can be excluded from its light, or the falloff can be that small to not look weird.
